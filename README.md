# Tied Together ♫

### A web application for middle school band members to connect for free private instruction with high school tutors!

### Features:
- tutors can create unique accounts with their KatyISD ID
- each tutor receives a personalized and sorted list of interested students based on numerous factors, such as student grade, skill level, instrument, whether they are enrolled in paid private lessons, etc.
- tutors can simultaneously have multiple students for instruction and disconnect at any time, freeing the student to be selected by a new tutor
- prospective students can access the app through a QR code and enter their information to be chosen for lessons
- all data is stored securely on MongoDB Atlas
- and so much more!
